                    Orthopedics, also known as orthopedic surgery, is a branch of medicine that focuses on the care of the skeletal system and its interconnecting parts.
                    These parts include the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>bones</li>
                        <li>muscles</li>
                        <li>joints</li>
                        <li>tendons</li>
                        <li>ligaments</li>
                        <li>nerves</li>
                    </ul>
                    There are generally two types of orthopedists: surgical and nonsurgical. The former are called orthopedic surgeons,
                    while nonsurgical orthopedists include physiatrists and physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists.<br><br>
                    An orthopedist often works as part of a larger orthopedic treatment team. This team may include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>physician assistants</li>
                        <li>nurse practitioners</li>
                        <li>occupational and physical therapists</li>
                        <li>athletic trainers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>What do orthopedists treat?</h2>
                    <br><br>
                    Orthopedists treat a wide variety of musculoskeletal conditions. These conditions may be present from birth, or they may result from an injury or age-related wear and tear.<br>
                    Below are some of the most common conditions that an orthopedist may treat:
                    <ul>
                        <li>joint pain from arthritis</li>
                        <li>bone fractures</li>
                        <li>soft tissue injuries, which are those that affect muscles, tendons, and ligaments</li>
                        <li>back pain</li>
                        <li>neck pain</li>
                        <li>shoulder pain and problems, such as bursitis</li>
                        <li>carpal tunnel syndrome</li>
                        <li>overuse and sports injuries, including sprains, tendinitis, meniscus tears, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears</li>
                        <li>congenital conditions, such as clubfoot and scoliosis</li>
                        <li>bone cancer</ul>
